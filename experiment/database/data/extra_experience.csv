AR for Art and Film Education includes installation-based AR art exhibitions and film screenings with educational information. Chanju Lee (the School of Liberal Arts) and Cindy Robertson (the School of Science and Technology) will collaborate to incorporate emerging technology AR into art and film. This AR exhibition will provide unique, immersive, and interactive user experiences and apprehensible information. Participants will explore the space of mixed reality and contemplate themes (diversity) and symbolic meanings of artwork. Lee’s film production students will create images and short movies about diversity, and Robertson’s digital media students will transfer the images to trackable markers and embed educational information about installed film and artwork on the HP Reveal AR application for handheld devices. This multidisciplinary project will integrate GGC students into a field of study which is beyond their current realm of expertise, improving multidisciplinary dialogue and understanding among art, film, and new technology. This AR exhibition will also stimulate social and intellectual growth in GGC students and improve their professional skills.

Chanju Lee (Film), Young Shim (Psychology), Matthew Boggan (Special Education), worked along the students’ external advisor, Vicki LaRoche (The Next Stop Director).  
The Georgia Gwinnett College (GGC) Next Stop Project is a community-based project in which students at GGC can gain career experiences through work with adults with developmental or acquired disabilities in the areas of psychology, film, and special education. Three faculty members from the School of Liberal Arts and School of Education directed this grant with support from The Next Stop, a non-profit organization for adults with intellectual disabilities. This project used an approach called the “Classroom without Walls.” This project provided valuable learning experiences that GGC students wouldn’t gain in a regular classroom setting.

작품 내용:
가상 세계에서 사람들은 다양한 자아를 형성한다.
더이상 한 사람으로써의 정체성과 세계관을 확립해 나갈 필요 없이, 가상세계에서 더욱 다채로운 페르소나를 갖춰 나가는 것이다.
이 작품은 인공지능에 의해 생성된 얼굴을 활용하여 가상 세계에서의 인간이라는 존재를 표현하였으며, 계속 해서 변화하는 얼굴을 통해 다중적 자아가 형성되는 과정을 나타내었다. 세포가 모여 생명이 만들어지듯, 입자가 모여 페르소나들이 만들어지는 과정을 확인할 수 있다.",ArtsCloud,2021-12-01,0e7bd87b-4a19-4527-8bb5-159ad112e44c,award

Campaign Description: 
Most people in Asia didn’t know Airbnb and in a region where Bed and Breakfasts aren’t commonplace, the notion of staying in a stranger’s home when you’re travelling is extra strange. We needed to open up Asian travellers to the idea that staying in an Airbnb that’s hosted by a local can be a magical experience. Our solution? Turn Asia’s biggest music superstar into a superhost. An Airbnb user himself, we partnered with G-Dragon to create an authentic social presence from inviting people into his home over teasing on Instagram and capturing the journey. G-Dragon invited five fans from around Asia to experience what it’s like to truly live in his neighbourhood of Itaewon. He checked them in, took them for dinner, told them about his favourite neighborhood spots and even left them Airbnb reviews. The partnership enabled massive organic engagement and media coverage throughout the region, increased brand awareness and spiked Airbnb sign-ups.",PR Awards Asia 2016,2016-06-01,12df4bcb-38f3-4c3d-aefd-f051974b27de,award

[Purpose and Planning Intent]

In line with its aspiration as a global luxury brand, GENESIS initiated the GENESIS 2.0 redesign project to provide a customer experience befitting a luxury brand while aligning with the latest digital trends. The project aimed to enhance customer web usability and convenience while implementing dynamic content to facilitate exploration and understanding of vehicle information. Additionally, the project introduced ""BUILD YOUR GENESIS,"" an online experience for configuring and estimating personalized orders, enriching the overall customer journey.
URL: https://www.genesis.com/kr/ko/main.html

[Key Highlights]

The GENESIS 2.0 project proceeded in two phases.

The first phase focused on enhancing dynamic content to showcase vehicle information dynamically and implementing the ""BUILD YOUR GENESIS"" feature in line with the global launch of new models. Subsequently, the second phase involved further refinement, strengthening integration with social channels, and optimizing mobile aspects such as color, layout, and components to conclude the redesign project.

The redesign resulted in overall traffic improvements and reduced bounce rates, indicating an enhanced customer journey on the webpage through intuitive UI/UX. Additionally, key metrics related to sales, such as conversion rates for estimates, test drives, and purchase consultations, also improved.

Furthermore, to ensure global scalability, a worldwide site was concurrently launched using a global standard design, enabling GENESIS to progressively apply the Genesis 2.0 design to international sites in the future.",i-AWARDS KOREA,2020-01-01,17f81998-d531-4aa0-ae7b-aa64c907e97a,award

부동산 가격은 다양한 요인들로 인해 정책의 의도와 부합하지 않은 경우가 많다. 이 때, 계량이 힘든 요인들은 정부의 의도대로 대책이 효과를 거둘지에 대한 예측을 어렵게 만든다. 이에 본 연구는 정책 발표 후 시장 참여자들의 초기 반응과 부동산 실거래가의 상관관계를 분석하여 시장 참여자들의 기대심리가 정책의 실효성을 예상할 수 있는 지표인지를 확인하고자 하였다. 텍스트 마이닝을 이용해 정책 이후 한 달 동안의 인터넷 게시글들을 분석하여 동향을 파악하였다. 정책 전후 가격 변동을 추적하기 위해 국토 교통부에서 제공하는 실거래가 데이터를 이용, 헤도닉 가격 모형을 설계하여 정책 전후의 가격 변화를 분석하였다. 분석 결과, 정책 발표에 따른 기대 심리가 부동산 실거래가와 상응하는 것을 확인할 수 있었다. 본 연구는 정책 발표 이후 정책에 대한 사람들의 기대 심리를 고려함으로써 정책의 실효성을 예상할 수 있음에 그 의의가 있다.

Korea government provides housing support policy including 'Happy-house'. However, the young and the elderly have serious problem of housing. It is because there is no indicator of demand forecast.
Therefore, I derived favorable factors and indicator of demand forecast.

First, I set target values to age group that can receive happy housing support.
It is divided by 4 groups(newly married couple, young people in society, office workers, the elderly).
I chose the algorithm 'Support Vector Machine' that shows the best performance.

미술품은 그 자체의 특수성 때문에 거래나 소유 시 다음과 같은 고질적인 문제점이 존재해 왔습니다. 첫째, 소유자의 사유지가 아닌 다른 곳에 장기 보관하는 특징 때문에 미술품에 대한 소유권 분쟁이 빈번하게 발생하며 도난 및 도난 시도가 종종 일어납니다. 둘째, 중앙화된 중개 업체들의 권력이 언제든 남용될 수 있습니다. 실제로 이러한 사례 역시 다수 존재합니다. 셋째, 전자 시스템화된 거래 방식이 아니기 때문에 이전 거래 내역 확인이 힘듭니다. 이를 악용하여 실제 시가를 부풀리는 사기 사례도 있습니다. 마지막으로 시스템화되지 않은 미술품의 특성을 이용하여 탈세, 돈세탁 등 재산 은닉의 수단으로 사용되는 경우가 많습니다.
최현숙의 ""미술품 등록제 도입을 위한 검토"" 논문을 살펴보면 이 문제들을 해결하기 위해서는 미술 시장을 투명하게 만들어야 하며, 이를 위해 미술품 등록제를 도입해야 한다고 강조하고 있습니다. 저희는 이 논문에서 제시한 미술품 등록제를 바탕으로 ERC-721 표준에 따른 NFT 기술을 도입한 새로운 거래 시스템을 개발했습니다.
저희가 개발한 시스템이 활용된다면 앞서 제시했던 문제들을 해결할 수 있을 것입니다. 첫째, 미술품과 1:1 대응된 NFT의 소유자만이 미술품의 소유자로 인정받기 때문에 소유권 분쟁이 사라질 것입니다. 둘째, 블록체인 기술을 이용하여 탈중앙화를 이뤄냈기 때문에 중개 업체들의 권력 남용이 불가능해질 것입니다. 셋째, 이 시스템으로 인해 미술품 거래의 전자 시스템화를 이뤄낼 수 있으며, 미술품에 대한 과거 거래 내역 조회가 가능해질 것입니다. 마지막으로 시스템화된 미술품 시장으로 인해 탈세, 돈세탁 등 재산 은닉 또한 막을 수 있을 것입니다.
저는 이 프로젝트에서 기사나 논문 등 다양한 자료 조사를 통해 현 미술품 거래 시장의 문제점을 분석하였습니다. 그리고 이를 해결하기 위한 새로운 서비스를 제안하였고 시스템 설계에 참여하였습니다.
이 프로젝트는 한국정보과학회가 주최한 KCC 2019 학부생 논문 경진대회에서 장려상을 수상하였습니다.",한국정보과학회,2019-08-01,1ccdba1d-6b21-4f80-9d81-75c6d501bd1e,award

HisAdvisor(히즈어드바이저)는 저출산 문제를 해결하는 AI 기반 장기 투자 솔루션으로 출산율 0.7 시대에 2030 예비 부모의 경제적 불안을 해소합니다.

2030세대의 핵심 고민인 자녀 양육비(평균 3.3억 원)와 경제적 불확실성을 해결하기 위해, 히즈어드바이저는 AI 기반 장기 자동 투자 솔루션을 제안했습니다.

- 매달 10만 원 투자로 자녀 교육자금 등 마련
- 투자 성향 및 재정 상태 분석 → 목표 달성 전략 수립
- Efficient Frontier 기반 포트폴리오 자동 구성
- 시장 변화에 따라 AI 리밸런싱 및 수익률 최적화
- 연평균 수익률 7.83% 성과 (김학주 교수 공동 개발)
- 챗봇 상담 및 프리미엄 투자자문 기능 포함
- 세대 간 자산관리 교육 및 자연스러운 상속 구조 설계

타깃은 자녀계획이 있는 2030 신혼부부 16만 명이며, 최근 정부의 ‘월 10만 원 아이사랑 적금’ 출시와 맞물려 높은 시장성과 정책 연계 가능성을 확인했습니다.

단기 수익보다 신앙과 믿음을 기반으로 한 장기적 안정을 추구하며, 복리의 힘으로 부모의 책임을 감당하고 다음 세대에 금융 지혜를 물려주는 청지기 플랫폼입니다.
